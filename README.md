# Industrial Defect Detection System

## Overview
Industrial defect detection systems are designed to identify flaws in products during manufacturing using computer vision and deep learning techniques. These systems improve quality assurance, reduce costs, and increase production efficiency.

## Working Process

### 1. Image Acquisition
High-resolution cameras or sensors capture images of products on the production line.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Resize and normalize images.
- Apply data augmentation (flip, rotate, etc.).

### 3. Feature Extraction
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts visual features and learns defect patterns.

### 4. Classification
The model classifies items as:
- Defective
- Non-defective
Or identifies specific defect types.

### 5. Output & Action
- Flag or remove defective items.
- Log defects for traceability.
- Optional: Retrain model with new data.

## Use Case: Automotive Weld Inspection

### Problem
Manual weld inspection is slow and prone to errors, missing critical defects like incomplete or misaligned welds.

### Solution
- Use cameras to capture weld images.
- Train a CNN to detect weld defects.
- Automatically flag faulty welds in real time.

### Benefits
- High-speed, real-time detection
- Increased accuracy (95%+)
- Reduced rework and inspection costs

## Sample Code Snippet

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128,128,3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
